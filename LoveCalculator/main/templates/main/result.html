            Dr. Love thinks that a relationship between {{love.male}} and
            {{love.female}} has a reasonable chance of working out, but on
            the other hand, it might not. Your relationship may
            suffer good and bad times. If things might not be working
            out as you would like them to, do not hesitate to talk about
            it with the person involved. Spend time together, talk with each other.
